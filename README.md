# Discovery of Circumstellar Debris around an SNIa Runaway

This repository contains the analysis code for Chandra et al (2021, in prep). All the code used to generate plots and simulations for the paper is contained here in Jupyter notebooks. Several data files are too large to host on GitHub or are under proprietary access. Don't hesitate to reach out to the corresponding author if you have any questions, or would like any additional data. 

The main code is stored in notebooks labelled 00-06. Auxilliary analysis is written in notebooks labelled 99. Main output plots can be found in the fig/ directory. 

All Python libraries that are used in this analysis are listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file.
